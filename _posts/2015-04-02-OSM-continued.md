The next Maptime Bend meetup is scheduled for Thursday, April 2!

###Next level OSM
 
Join us for a special Field Trip edition of Maptime Bend! We'll be getting outside (assuming the weather is nice) to collect some nearby path data with GPS handsets or smartphones, then bringing that data back to the "lab" and using it to create new paths in OpenStreetMap.
