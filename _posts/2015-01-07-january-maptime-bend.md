**UPDATE 2:** QGIS can take a while to download and install, and if we all try to do it at once on a restaurant wifi, we'll never get it done. **There will be a couple of thumb drives with installers available,** but if you have time to download and install beforehand, it'll save time for all those fancy raster algebra and spatial join demos.

There are a couple ways to install QGIS. A good way for Windows users is [OSGeo4W](http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/). Unfortunately there is not a Mac version. (The "W" stands for Windows, after all.) The official installer for QGIS is [here](http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html), but the Mac install requires you to install a lot of separate dependencies. (Don't even get me started on trying to _update_ QGIS on a Mac.)

The simplest way I've found is using [Boundless's QGIS installers](http://boundlessgeo.com/solutions/solutions-software/qgis/qgis-download/). Although their release is a couple versions behind the latest QGIS build, they include everything you'll need to get started. Their site also requires you to enter your email address, and then they'll email you a link to the installers. For your convenience, I've done that already and have linked directly to the ZIP archives here:

Windows installer: [Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ewlw2lr6md0fdxq/OpenGeoSuite-QGIS-windows-latest.zip?dl=0)

Mac installer: [Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vlh8elshnb7175s/OpenGeoSuite-QGIS-osx-latest.zip?dl=0)

Looking forward to seeing everyone there!

**UPDATE:** Moved the Maptime Bend meetup to Wednesday, Jan. 7 to avoid conflict with another popular meetup! So many meetups, so little time!

Join us on Jan. 7, 2015, as we explore QGIS, a free and open-source desktop application for creating, editing and exporting almost all types of geospatial data. More details to come!
