UPDATE: Moved the Maptime Bend meetup to Wednesday, Jan. 7 to avoid conflict with another popular meetup! So many meetups, so little time!

Join us on Jan. 7, 2015, as we explore QGIS, a free and open-source desktop application for creating, editing and exporting almost all types of geospatial data. More details to come!
