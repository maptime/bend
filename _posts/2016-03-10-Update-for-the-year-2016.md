Despite the lack of posts here, we've been quite busy here at Maptime Bend. It turns out that the [Meetup page](http://meetup.com/maptimebend) does most of the heavy lifting for organizing our meetups. We ended up not having meetups in December 2015 or January 2016, but we came back strong in February with [an evening with POSTGIS](http://www.meetup.com/maptimebend/events/228275346/).

March's meetup, which is scheduled to start 5 minutes from the time of this post, stars [Jereme Monteau from Trailhead Labs](http://www.meetup.com/maptimebend/events/229050273/).

In April, we invite all mapheads to attend our [Cartography Fair](http://www.meetup.com/maptimebend/events/229051741/), where we'll showcase some of the work of local mapmakers.

Join our [Meetup group](http://meetup.com/maptimebend) for more frequent updates.
