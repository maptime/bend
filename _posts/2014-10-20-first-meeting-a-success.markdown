###Notes

Introductions were made, and everyone said who they were and what their interest in #maptime was.

Quickly moved into a discussion of cool tools and possible collaborative projects.

One project that everyone agreed would be fun to work on together was a trail map repository and website, both hiking and mountain biking.

Friant mentioned [CodeOregon.com](http://codeoregon.com "CodeOregon") as a great resource for learning basic front-end development tools.

Discussed Trello group and invited new participants for planning future meetings.

Discussed ideas for future meeting topics, including:

- OpenStreetMap basics
