Next week's meetup is coming together. We've got the space and are prepping our first tutorial!

Bring a laptop and a healthy curiosity and we'll walk you through setting up your first open-source webmap powered by Leaflet, then move into general discussion and goals for the next meetup!

### [RSVP now on our Lanyrd page!](http://lanyrd.com/2014/maptimebend/)
