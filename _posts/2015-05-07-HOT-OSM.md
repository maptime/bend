The next Maptime Bend meetup is scheduled for Thursday, May 7!

#Get involved
 
Come join us this week for Maptime.  We will be focusing on helping crisis mapping teams in Nepal with mapping efforts.  We will be covering how to use the Red Cross Humanitarian OSM Tasking Management Tool to support mapping efforts in Nepal and future incidents which require mapping support.
